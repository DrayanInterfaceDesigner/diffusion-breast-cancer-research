# Methods

The authors proposed a new method using a DNNSV(Deep Neural Network with Support Vector) for classifying breast cancer images. They used a specialized method of segmentation; a modified version of histo-sigmoid functions, which achieved high-accuracy results and clearly better sepparation than classic FCM and Threshold segmentation methods.

They don't provide much detail about normalization and dataset enhancement methods, besides saying they're "complex".

They've used an apparently closed dataset "M. G Cancer Hospi- tal & Research Institute, Visakhapatnam, India histopathology breast cancer dataset".
